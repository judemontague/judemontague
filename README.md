- 👋 Hi, I’m @judemontague
- 👀 I explore live coding, hammond organs and poetry. My main workshop is MONTAGUE ARMSTRONG. With Matt Armstrong I work with Hammond organs and other rescue equipment in our laboratory. I am also an etcher and printmaker and create new visual work upstairs. I worked for Reuters TV archive for ten years and am on a lifelong journey into media history and new media. I create a regular weekly show for Resonance FM called 'The News Agents' - Sat 2.30pm-3.30pm www.resonancefm.com archived at thenewsagents.blogspot.com
- 🌱 I’m currently learning p5, hydra, superCollider, TidalCycles. I'm co-ordinating a new series of Algoraves in Hastings, Sussex, 'the home of television' where John Logie Baird carried out his analogue tv experiments and had his famous breakthrough. My laboratory is at 15 Kings Road, St Leonards-on-Sea please come visit and explore with me.
- 💞️ Collaboration - bringing together new media, live coding television, archive, rescue instruments, sanctuary for the lost and forgotten sights sounds and smells of broadcasting past.
